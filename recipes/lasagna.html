        <ol>
            <li>To begin crafting this recipe, firstly, preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius.
            <li>If using mushrooms, mushrooms are to be quartered and sautéed with a teaspoon of olive oil until slightly done. It takes about 2 minutes on medium flame.</li>
            <li>In a large bring salted water to boil and put in the Del Monte lasagne pasta sheets. Allow it to cook to al dente- about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove and drain. Drizzle a little olive oil over them so they don't stick.</li>
            <li>In a large frying pan, add enough oil, heat and fry the onions till translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and then the minced meat. Let it brown a bit and then cover and cook over low heat, for ten minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the pureed tomatoes, the Del Monte pasta paste, herbs, pepper and salt and let it again cook on a low fire till the meat is a thick, mushy consistency. Add the fresh, torn basil leaves last.</li>
            <li>Keep one tablespoon of cheese aside. In a bowl, beat eggs lightly, add the remaining cheeses, beat again and keep aside.</li>
            <li>In a flat bottomed lasagna pan, ladle 1/3 rd of the meat sauce to cover the bottom.</li>
            <li>Gently place 3 pasta sheets to cover the meat, overlapping them a bit.</li>
            <li>Scatter 1/3rd of the mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Use about 1/3 rd of the egg-cheese mixture to drizzle over the top of the mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process till three layers of the sauce, pasta, veggies and egg sauce is done. Over the last layer of egg sauce, scatter the grated cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake at 180 degrees for an hour. Let it sit for about ten minutes before digging into it.</li>
